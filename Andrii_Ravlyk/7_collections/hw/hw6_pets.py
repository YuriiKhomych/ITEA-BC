'''6. Pets: Make several dictionaries, where the name of each dictionary is the name of a pet.
    * In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the ownerâ€™s name.
    * Store these dictionaries in a list called pets.
    * Next, loop through your list and as you do print everything you know about each pet.'''
