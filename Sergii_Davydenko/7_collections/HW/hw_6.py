#
# Pets: Make several dictionaries, where the name of each dictionary is the name of a pet.
#
#     In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the ownerâ€™s name.
#     Store these dictionaries in a list called pets.
#     Next, loop through your list and as you do print everything you know about each pet.
