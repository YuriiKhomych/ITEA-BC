# 6. Define a function `overlapping()` that takes two lists and
# returns True if they have at least one member in common,
# False otherwise. You may use your `is_member()` function,
# or the in operator, but for the sake of the exercise,
# you should (also) write it using two nested for-loops.

# Its work

first = input("Enter first lists: ").split()
second = input("Enter second lists: ").split()


def overlapping(first, second):
    for f in first:
        for s in second:
            if f == s:
                return True
    return False

print(overlapping(first, second))


# Work for SET
# count = fist.intersection(sec)
# + count
